        I am creative and an entrepreneur. I launched my business ManoonCreation on Etsy to sell my macrame bracelets to people around the world. 🌎

      <h2>Passions</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always been passionate about reading 📚, it’s my favorite way to escape into another world. Whether it’s fantasy, thrillers, or anything in between, I love getting lost in a good story. I'm also sportive. I swam for 14 years 🏊🏻‍♀️, then spent six years climbing 🧗‍♀️, which I loved because every climb felt like a challenge I had to conquer. Reaching the top was always such a thrill! These days, I keep moving by running three times a week🏃🏻‍♀️.

      <h2>Discover the World</h2>
      <p>
        I love exploring new places around the world 🗺️, not just during vacations but as part of my everyday life. That’s why I’m so keen to work abroad, whether it’s full-time or part-time. For me, it’s the best way to truly experience other cultures. This ties into my passion for learning languages, I already speak four: French and English, which are my native languages, but also Spanish and Italian. I’m always looking for ways to improve and add to that list!

      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <p>
        I’m really excited about building a career 👩🏻‍💻 as a marketing operator or marketing trader because I love how this field mixes creativity and strategy to achieve results. Right now, I’m actively looking for an internship in this area to get hands-on experience and learn as much as possible. I’m eager to work with a team where I can put my skills into practice, pick up new ones, and grow while contributing to real projects.
